## **Features**
1. **Climate Chatbot**: An interactive chatbot that answers questions about climate change, sustainability, and environmental issues.
2. **Climate Change Tracker**: Displays real-time weather data and tracks environmental metrics like temperature, CO2 levels, and climate trends.
3. **Carbon Footprint Calculator**: A tool to help users estimate their carbon footprint and provides suggestions to reduce it.
4. **Climate News Aggregator**: Pulls the latest climate news from top news sources to keep users informed about the latest developments in climate science and policy.

## **Getting Started**

These instructions will help you set up and run **GaiaGuard** locally on your machine for development or testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

You’ll need to have **Python 3.x** installed on your computer. If you don’t have Python, you can download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You will also need **Streamlit** and other dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gaia-guard.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd gaia-guard
   ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have all the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the app**:
   After installing all dependencies, you can run the app with Streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

   Your app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.
